## About Me 
Github

🔭 I'm a mechanical engineer venturing into the exciting world of programming as FullStack Developer. I’m currently working on my Portfolio and finishing up some other projects. I am using plain html and css to create it. My main collaborative project is deployed in Vercel, the others for now will be linked to my github profile.

🌱 I’m currently learning Angular and Typescript.

👯 I like great challenges and I undertake them with passion, commitment and determination. I am interested in web 🖥️ and moblie 📱 development, mainly back-end.

💬 Talk to me about JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Sequelize, Express, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Redux, and obviously a little about TypeScript and Angular.
